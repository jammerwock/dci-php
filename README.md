Documentation is forthcoming; in the meantime, for an introduction to DCI, see:
http://www.artima.com/articles/dci_vision.html

Note that DCI now stands for Data, Context, and Interaction (the above article is a great introduction but is slightly out of date).

For more articles and information, see:

and this book by DCI's co-creator, which has a chapter on DCI:
Lean Architecture: for Agile Software Development
